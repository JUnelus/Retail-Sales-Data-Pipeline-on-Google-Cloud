# Retail-Sales-Data-Pipeline-on-Google-Cloud
The project will build an end-to-end data pipeline that ingests retail sales data from a CSV file, stores it in Google Cloud Storage (GCS), processes and transforms it using Google Cloud Dataflow (Apache Beam), and loads it into BigQuery for querying and analysis. You can visualize the process using Google Looker Studio (Data Studio).
